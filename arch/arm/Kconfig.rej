+ 	  This option enables the workaround for erratum 764369
+ 	  affecting Cortex-A9 MPCore with two or more processors (all
+ 	  current revisions). Under certain timing circumstances, a data
+ 	  cache line maintenance operation by MVA targeting an Inner
+ 	  Shareable memory region may fail to proceed up to either the
+ 	  Point of Coherency or to the Point of Unification of the
+ 	  system. This workaround adds a DSB instruction before the
+ 	  relevant cache maintenance functions and sets a specific bit
+ 	  in the diagnostic control register of the SCU.
